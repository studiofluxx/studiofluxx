# [Bootstrap 3 Fixed Width Sidebar Template](http://www.digitalinternals.com/design/bootstrap-fixed-width-sidebar/555/)

A Bootstrap 3 template to create fixed width sidebars.

## Introduction

This template creates 2 css styles: `col-fixed` and `col-fluid` that will be used to replace the standard Bootstrap `col-*` grid classes. 
* `col-fixed` has a fixed width and is used for the sidebar
* `col-fluid` uses the remaining width and is used for the main content

In this template, `col-fixed` is set to 350 pixels. Note that on mobile (<768px), it will be set to 100% width.
